    Run CredBank example with provided combiner and scorer.

    With The Credibility study we do not have individual raters, so we simulate them. Since the AnonymousBayesian \
    combiner is anonymous, ie, it doesn't matter who rated what, then we can just simulate these raters.

    In this case, we say that a rating was positive if credibility was rated high or medium high. Otherwise its not.

    Parameters
    ----------
    combiner : Combiner
        Combiner function
    scorer : Scorer
        Scoring function
    max_k : int
        Maximum number of raters to use when calculating survey power curve. Lower values dramatically speed up \
        execution of the procedure. No default is set, but this value is typically equal to the average number of \
        raters per item.
    max_items : int
        Maximum items to use from the dataset. Fewer items increases the speed of the procedure by results in loss \
        of statistical power. No default is set. If this value is smaller than the number of items in the dataset then \
        the function will only take the first max_items items from the dataset thereby ignoring some data.
    bootstrap_samples : int
        Number of samples to use when calculating survey equivalence. Like the number of samples in a t-test, more \
        samples increases the statistical power, but each requires additional computational time. No default is set.
